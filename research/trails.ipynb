Both upper and lower sash \\nslide within tracks on the window jambs.\\n• Fixed - The sash does not move.\\n• Single hung sash - Two sash elements, one \\nabove the other. Only the lower sash moves.\\n• Ornamental or specialty windows - Unusual \\nshapes, such as a circular window; or distinct \\nglazing patterns, such as a diamond-shaped, \\nmulti-pane window subdivided with wood \\nmuntins or lead cames, which may be \\nassociated with a particular building style. \\nThese may be fixed or operable.\\nWindows are also defined and characterized by their \\nmaterials. Wood frames are the common residential \\ntype, often combined with decorative leadwork. \\nSteel frames become more popular for residential \\nbuildings with changes in manufacturing and style, \\nusually in casement form and often for apartment \\nbuildings. Each material has a very distinctive \\ncharacter. Each is also strong and durable.\\nDeterioration of Historic Windows \\nProperly maintained, original wood windows \\nwill provide excellent service indefinitely. \\nMost problems that occur result from a lack of \\nmaintenance. The accumulation of layers of paint \\non a wood sash for example may make operation \\ndifficult. Using proper painting techniques, such as \\nremoving upper paint layers and preparing a proper \\nsubstrate, can solve this problem. Repairs to restore \\nthe functionality and efficiency of a double-hung \\nsash, for example, are usually relatively simple.Window Features \\nThe size, shape, proportions and profiles of a \\nhistoric window are among its essential features. \\nMany early residential windows in Salt Lake City \\nwere vertically-proportioned, for example. Another \\nimportant feature is the number of “lights,” or \\npanes dividing a window. Typical windows for \\nmany late nineteenth century cottages were “one-\\nover-one” sash types, in which one large pane of \\nglass was hung above another single pane. Other \\nimportant features are the design of surrounding \\nwindow casings, the depth and profile of window \\nsash elements, and the materials of which they were \\nconstructed. \\nThe majority of early residential windows use wood \\nas a framing material. From the late 19th century \\nsteel became a window frame option, initially for \\ncommercial, industrial and civic buildings, and \\nincreasingly for residential structures. In both cases,  \\nwood or metal, the components of the frame have \\ndistinct roles, patterns, dimensions and profiles, \\narising from a combination of style and function.\\nThe manner in which windows are combined or \\narranged on a building facade (the fenestration) \\nalso may be distinctly associated with a building \\nstyle. For example, on some bungalows a large \\ncentral pane of fixed glass was flanked by a pair \\nof vertically-proportioned casement windows. \\nThis compound window frequently occurred on \\nbuilding fronts under broad porches. (See the \\ndiscussion of individual building styles in the \\nHistoric Context and Architectural Styles, PART I \\nSection 4, for additional information about specific \\nwindow types.)

If surfaces fail to drain \\nproperly, water may collect and eventually seep \\nthrough. Condensation during winter months \\ncan also cause problems over time. Deterioration \\nwill gradually occur when the paint surface or \\nthe putty is cracked, peeling or loose.

Windows\\nA Preservation Handbook for Historic Residential Properties & Districts\\nFirst, determine the window’s architectural \\nsignificance. Is it a key character-defining element \\nof the building? Typically, windows on the front \\nof the building, and on sides designed to be visible \\nfrom the street, are key character-defining elements. \\nA window in an obscure location, or on the rear \\nof a structure, may not be. Greater flexibility in \\nthe treatment or replacement of such secondary \\nwindows may be appropriate.\\nSecond, inspect the window to determine \\nits condition. Distinguish superficial signs of \\ndeterioration from the actual failure of window \\ncomponents. Peeling paint and dried wood, for \\nexample, may be more superficial than serious \\nproblems, and often do not indicate that a window \\nis beyond repair. What constitutes a deteriorated \\nwindow? A rotted sill may require its replacement, \\nbut it does not indicate the need for an entire new \\nwindow. Determining window condition should \\noccur on a case-by-case basis. However, as a general \\nrule, a window merits preservation, with perhaps \\nselective replacement of components. If more than \\n50 percent of the window components can not be \\nrepaired, then consider replacement. \\nThird, determine the appropriate treatment for the \\nwindow. Where the window is inoperable, remove \\nexcess paint and free or replace any mechanism \\ncomponents that don’t work. Surfaces may require \\ncleaning and patching. Some components may \\nhave deteriorated beyond repair. Patching and \\nsplicing in new material for only those portions \\nthat are decayed should be considered in such a \\ncase, rather than replacing the entire window.

These steps \\nwill dramatically reduce heat loss, while preserving \\nthe character-defining historic features of the \\nwindow. They will also improve acoustic efficiency.\\nSteel frames can be upgraded through attention to \\nand removal of paint or rust accumulation, followed \\nby weatherization. Paint and rust become common \\nissues that result from deferred maintenance and \\nthat can inhibit the effective opening and operation \\nof the window. Remedial work will restore the \\nprofiles of the opening and fixed sections of the \\nframe and the precise fit of the original frame. The \\nwindow can then be weatherstripped to enhance \\nenergy and acoustic efficiency.\\nWhere additional energy or acoustic efficiency \\nmight be a concern, consider installing a storm \\nwindow. It may be applied to the interior or the \\nexterior of the window. A storm window should be \\ndesigned to match the historic window divisions \\nsuch that the exterior appearance of the original \\nwindow is not obscured. \\nResearch in recent years confirms that a weatherized \\nhistoric window with an additional storm window \\n(internal or external) will match or exceed the \\nenergy efficiency of a replacement window, at \\na small proportion of the cost.

Distinct \\nwindow designs and the pattern of windows (the \\nfenestration) help to define many historic building \\nstyles. \\nHistoric windows differ from contemporary ones in \\nfundamental ways. One is their relationship to the \\nwall plane of the building. Historic windows are \\noften inset into relatively deep openings or reveals. \\nSecond, they have surrounding casings and sash \\ncomponents with substantial and complex profiles \\nwhich cast shadows. These shadows then create \\neven more complex patterns on the facade.

Both upper and lower sash \\nslide within tracks on the window jambs.\\n• Fixed - The sash does not move.\\n• Single hung sash - Two sash elements, one \\nabove the other. Only the lower sash moves.\\n• Ornamental or specialty windows - Unusual \\nshapes, such as a circular window; or distinct \\nglazing patterns, such as a diamond-shaped, \\nmulti-pane window subdivided with wood \\nmuntins or lead cames, which may be \\nassociated with a particular building style. \\nThese may be fixed or operable.\\nWindows are also defined and characterized by their \\nmaterials. Wood frames are the common residential \\ntype, often combined with decorative leadwork. \\nSteel frames become more popular for residential \\nbuildings with changes in manufacturing and style, \\nusually in casement form and often for apartment \\nbuildings. Each material has a very distinctive \\ncharacter. Each is also strong and durable.\\nDeterioration of Historic Windows \\nProperly maintained, original wood windows \\nwill provide excellent service indefinitely. \\nMost problems that occur result from a lack of \\nmaintenance. The accumulation of layers of paint \\non a wood sash for example may make operation \\ndifficult. Using proper painting techniques, such as \\nremoving upper paint layers and preparing a proper \\nsubstrate, can solve this problem. Repairs to restore \\nthe functionality and efficiency of a double-hung \\nsash, for example, are usually relatively simple.Window Features \\nThe size, shape, proportions and profiles of a \\nhistoric window are among its essential features. \\nMany early residential windows in Salt Lake City \\nwere vertically-proportioned, for example. Another \\nimportant feature is the number of “lights,” or \\npanes dividing a window. Typical windows for \\nmany late nineteenth century cottages were “one-\\nover-one” sash types, in which one large pane of \\nglass was hung above another single pane. Other \\nimportant features are the design of surrounding \\nwindow casings, the depth and profile of window \\nsash elements, and the materials of which they were \\nconstructed. \\nThe majority of early residential windows use wood \\nas a framing material. From the late 19th century \\nsteel became a window frame option, initially for \\ncommercial, industrial and civic buildings, and \\nincreasingly for residential structures. In both cases,  \\nwood or metal, the components of the frame have \\ndistinct roles, patterns, dimensions and profiles, \\narising from a combination of style and function.\\nThe manner in which windows are combined or \\narranged on a building facade (the fenestration) \\nalso may be distinctly associated with a building \\nstyle. For example, on some bungalows a large \\ncentral pane of fixed glass was flanked by a pair \\nof vertically-proportioned casement windows. \\nThis compound window frequently occurred on \\nbuilding fronts under broad porches. (See the \\ndiscussion of individual building styles in the \\nHistoric Context and Architectural Styles, PART I \\nSection 4, for additional information about specific \\nwindow types.) All of these features are elements of \\nhistoric window designs that should be preserved.'),\n",

If surfaces fail to drain \\nproperly, water may collect and eventually seep \\nthrough. Condensation during winter months \\ncan also cause problems over time. Deterioration \\nwill gradually occur when the paint surface or \\nthe putty is cracked, peeling or loose. Decay may \\nmake operation of the window difficult and, if left \\nuntreated, can result in significant deterioration \\nof window components. In most cases, historic \\nwindows are not susceptible to damage if a good \\ncoat of paint is maintained and the putty is sound.\\nSteel frames are vulnerable to the same processes, \\nalthough they react differently. Moisture \\npenetration to the frame will cause rust which will \\ngradually expand and distort the surface of the \\nframe section. The rusting of steel frames tends \\nto be slow and in most cases the corrosion will be \\nrelatively superficial, with the original frame still \\nstructurally sound. \\nRepair of Historic Windows\\nWhenever possible, repair a historic window, rather \\nthan replace it. In most cases it is in fact easier, and \\nmore economical, to repair an existing window \\nrather than to replace it. In addition the original \\nmaterials contribute to the historic character of the \\nbuilding. The materials and craftsmanship tend to \\nbe of very high quality, and even when replaced \\nwith an exact duplicate window, which is difficult \\nto achieve, a portion of the historic building fabric \\nis lost and therefore such treatment should be \\navoided.

There are a series of recommendations and/or \\nrequirements for lead-safe working which should be reviewed \\nprior to any work.  Lead-based paint should not be considered \\na reason to remove and replace historic, character-defining \\nmaterials or features, including windows, doors details and \\ntrim.

Windows\\nA Preservation Handbook for Historic Residential Properties & Districts\\nFirst, determine the window’s architectural \\nsignificance. Is it a key character-defining element \\nof the building? Typically, windows on the front \\nof the building, and on sides designed to be visible \\nfrom the street, are key character-defining elements. \\nA window in an obscure location, or on the rear \\nof a structure, may not be. Greater flexibility in \\nthe treatment or replacement of such secondary \\nwindows may be appropriate.\\nSecond, inspect the window to determine \\nits condition. Distinguish superficial signs of \\ndeterioration from the actual failure of window \\ncomponents. Peeling paint and dried wood, for \\nexample, may be more superficial than serious \\nproblems, and often do not indicate that a window \\nis beyond repair. What constitutes a deteriorated \\nwindow? A rotted sill may require its replacement, \\nbut it does not indicate the need for an entire new \\nwindow. Determining window condition should \\noccur on a case-by-case basis. However, as a general \\nrule, a window merits preservation, with perhaps \\nselective replacement of components. If more than \\n50 percent of the window components can not be \\nrepaired, then consider replacement. \\nThird, determine the appropriate treatment for the \\nwindow. Where the window is inoperable, remove \\nexcess paint and free or replace any mechanism \\ncomponents that don’t work. Surfaces may require \\ncleaning and patching. Some components may \\nhave deteriorated beyond repair. Patching and \\nsplicing in new material for only those portions \\nthat are decayed should be considered in such a \\ncase, rather than replacing the entire window. If \\nthe entire window must be replaced, the new one \\nshould match the original in appearance.

Windows\\nA Preservation Handbook for Historic Residential Properties & Districts\\nThe most cost-effective energy conservation \\nmeasures for most historic windows are to replace \\nglazing compound, repair the wood members if \\nnecessary (usually the frame will be structurally \\nsound) and install weather stripping. These steps \\nwill dramatically reduce heat loss, while preserving \\nthe character-defining historic features of the \\nwindow.

Remedial work will restore the \\nprofiles of the opening and fixed sections of the \\nframe and the precise fit of the original frame. The \\nwindow can then be weatherstripped to enhance \\nenergy and acoustic efficiency.\\nWhere additional energy or acoustic efficiency \\nmight be a concern, consider installing a storm \\nwindow. It may be applied to the interior or the \\nexterior of the window. A storm window should be \\ndesigned to match the historic window divisions \\nsuch that the exterior appearance of the original \\nwindow is not obscured. \\nResearch in recent years confirms that a weatherized \\nhistoric window with an additional storm window \\n(internal or external) will match or exceed the \\nenergy efficiency of a replacement window, at \\na small proportion of the cost. Acoustically, the \\noriginal with a storm window will tend to be more \\nefficient than a replacement window, as a result of \\nthe wider air gap between the two planes of glass. \\nRefer to the Additional Information section at \\nthe end of this chapter, or the Appendix, for more \\ninformation.Maintenance tips for Windows\\n• Maintain a good coat of paint on all exposed surfaces.\\n• Replace old glazing compound.\\n• Install new weather-stripping to reduce air leaks.When a window is to be replaced, the new one \\nshould match the appearance of the original to \\nthe greatest extent possible.\\nExternal wood-framed storm windows designed \\nto fit the primary framework of the original.'),\n",

       "'Windows are essential components of any building, offering natural light, ventilation, and aesthetic appeal. They come in various types and styles, each suited to different needs and preferences. Below is an overview of the classifications, materials, and features of windows, as well as maintenance tips to ensure their longevity.\\n\\n### Types of Windows\\n\\n1. **Fixed Windows**: These do not open and are used primarily for light and visibility. They are often seen in large expanses where ventilation is not necessary.\\n\\n2. **Sliding Windows**: These operate by sliding open horizontally. They are easy to use and provide a wide view, making them popular in contemporary designs.\\n\\n3. **Pivoted Windows**: These windows rotate on a pivot point, allowing for ventilation at the top or bottom of the window. They offer flexibility in airflow.\\n\\n4. **Double Hung Windows**: These feature two sashes that slide vertically, allowing for ventilation from both the top and bottom. They are classic and versatile.\\n\\n5. **Louvered Windows**: Composed of slats that can be adjusted, louvered windows provide excellent ventilation. They are often used in warmer climates.\\n\\n6. **Casement Windows**: Hinged at the side, these windows open outward, offering unobstructed views and good airflow. They are often more energy-efficient due to their tight seal when closed.\\n\\n7. **Metal Windows**: Typically made from aluminum or steel, these windows are durable and often used in commercial buildings. They offer a modern aesthetic.\\n\\n8. **Sash Windows**: These consist of one or more movable panels, or sashes, that can slide vertically or horizontally. They are traditional in design and can be found in historic and modern homes alike.\\n\\n9. **Corner Windows**: These wrap around the corner of a building, providing unique views and a distinctive architectural feature.\\n\\n10. **Bay Windows**: These extend outward from the main walls of the building, creating a nook and allowing more light into the room.\\n\\n11. **Dormer Windows**: Installed in a sloping roof, dormers add headspace, light, and ventilation to upper levels of a home.\\n\\n### Materials Used in Windows\\n\\n- **Wood**: Offers excellent insulation and aesthetic appeal but requires regular maintenance to prevent rot and damage.\\n  \\n- **Vinyl**: Low maintenance and energy-efficient. It does not require painting and withstands weather well.\\n  \\n- **Aluminum**: Strong and lightweight, aluminum windows are resistant to corrosion but can conduct heat, affecting energy efficiency.\\n  \\n- **Fiberglass**: Highly durable and energy-efficient, fiberglass can match the appearance of wood while requiring less maintenance.\\n\\n- **Composite Materials**: Combine the benefits of different materials, offering durability and aesthetic versatility.\\n\\n### Glass Types\\n\\n- **Single-Pane**: Basic glass that provides minimal insulation. Generally not recommended for energy efficiency.\\n  \\n- **Double-Pane**: Two layers of glass with a gap that can be filled with gas (argon or krypton) to improve insulation.\\n  \\n- **Triple-Pane**: Three layers of glass that provide superior insulation and soundproofing, ideal for extreme climates.\\n  \\n- **Low-E Coatings**: Reflects infrared light, keeping heat inside in winter and blocking heat from the sun in summer, improving energy efficiency.\\n\\n### Energy Efficiency\\n\\nWhen selecting windows, consider their U-factor (a measure of heat transfer) and Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC) which indicates how much solar radiation is admitted. Windows with Energy Star ratings meet energy efficiency guidelines set by the EPA.\\n\\n### Maintenance Tips\\n\\nTo maintain windows effectively:\\n- Keep a good coat of paint on all exposed wooden surfaces to prevent decay.\\n- Regularly check seals and weatherstripping for wear and replace as needed.\\n- Clean glass surfaces with non-abrasive cleaners to preserve clarity.\\n- Inspect and replace old glazing compounds to prevent drafts.\\n\\n### Innovations and Trends\\n\\nRecent trends in window manufacturing include increased use of smart technology, such as automated window systems that can adjust based on temperature and light levels. There is also a growing emphasis on sustainability, with manufacturers focusing on eco-friendly materials and processes to reduce environmental impact.\\n\\nIn summary, understanding the various types of windows, their materials, energy-efficient features, and maintenance needs can help you make informed decisions whether you are building, renovating, or simply maintaining a property. If you have specific needs or scenarios in mind, feel free to ask for more tailored advice!'"
